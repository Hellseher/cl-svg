# cl-svg
Produce Scalable Vector Graphics files with Common Lisp


This is a basic library for producing SVG files. It makes
simple things easy (well, easier), but makes no attempt
to offer the full freedom of SVG, for which you'd be better
off using an XML library.

See `docs/API.md` for how to use this library.
